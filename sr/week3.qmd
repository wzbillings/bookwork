This homework covers the material from Lectures 5 and 6, and the content from
book Chapters 5 and 6. The questions are reproduced almost identically from
[Richard McElreath's original assignment](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2023/blob/main/homework/week03.pdf), I did not write them. I only wrote these solutions.

From the Homework:

> The problems are based on the same data. The data in `data(foxes)` are 116
foxes from 30 different urban groups in Engalnd. These fox groups are like
street gangs. Group size (`groupsize`) varies from 2 to 8 individuals. Each
group maintains its own (almsot exclusive) urban territory. Some territories
are larger than others. The `area` variable encodes this information. Some
territories also have more `avgfood` than others. And food influences the
`weight` of each fox. Assume this DAG:

```{r}
library(dagitty)
dag <- dagitty::dagitty(
	"dag {
		A -> F -> G -> W
		F -> W
	}"
)

# Specify instructions for plotting the DAG, then do that
dagitty::coordinates(dag) <-
	list(
		x = c(A = 2, F = 1, G = 3, W = 2),
		y = c(A = 1, F = 2, G = 2, W = 3)
	)

plot(dag)
```

> where $F$ is `avgfood`, $G$ is `groupsize`, $A$ is `area`, and $W$ is
`weight`.

**1.** Use the backdoor criterion and estimate the total causal influence of
$A$ on $F$. What effect would increasing the area of
a territory have on the amount of food inside of it?

:::

There are no confounds and there is in fact nothing else on the causal
pathway from $A$ to $F$. So these are the only two variables that need to
be in this model. I'll do a simple linear regression with just some default
priors to estimate this.

```{r}
# Setup
library(rethinking)
data(foxes)

# Standardize the variables
D <-
	foxes |>
	dplyr::select(
		F = avgfood,
		A = area,
		W = weight,
		G = groupsize
	) |>
	dplyr::mutate(
		dplyr::across(dplyr::everything(), standardize)
	) |>
	as.list()


set.seed(54564)
# The model
a_on_f <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		F ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b * A,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = D
)
rethinking::precis(a_on_f)
```
 
So we see that the estimate of the total causal effect of $A$ on $F$ is
$0.88$ with an $89\%$ CI of $0.81$ to $0.95$. Let's plot the distribution
really quick just to get a better idea.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
rethinking::dens(extract.samples(a_on_f)$b, lwd = 3)
```

The density is centered around 0.88, with our model identifying a range of
plausible values for around 0.81 to 0.95. In general, we can observe a
positive effect of area size on the amount of food available in a territory.
This makes sense, because if all of these foxes are from around the same
region, there should be a similar amount of food available across the area,
so increasing the size of the territory increases the amount of available
food. This might not have been the case if the foxes were from varying
environments, where a large territory might ne necessary for a fox in a food-poor
environment to have the same food availbility in a food-rich environment.

**2.** Infer the **total** causal effect of adding food $F$ to a territory on
the weight $W$ of foxes. Can you calculate the causal effect by simulating an
intervention on food?

:::

Again, we don't need to control anything to estimate this total causal effect.
$G$ is a mediator of the relationship of $F$ on $W$ and $A$ is a cause of $F$
so we don't need to control for either of these. I'll fit another model
with nondescript priors.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
f_on_w_total <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + bF * F,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		bF ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = D
)
f_on_w_total |> rethinking::coeftab() |> rethinking::coeftab_plot()
```

From the model estimates, we can see that, in general, the effect of food
availibility on fox weight does not seem to be very strong. The point estimate
is slightly negative, with the credible interval reflecting a wide range of
potential values of either direction.

Now we can simulate an intervention on the amount of food. That is, we're
estimating $f(W \mid \text{do}(F))$ by simulation. First we will draw the
DAG for when we $\text{do}(F)$. In this DAG, we delete all arrows into $F$
(because we are controlling the value of it).

```{r}
do_f <- dagitty::dagitty(
	"dag {
		F -> G -> W
		F -> W
	}"
)

# Specify instructions for plotting the DAG, then do that
dagitty::coordinates(do_f) <-
	list(
		x = c(F = 1, G = 3, W = 2),
		y = c(F = 2, G = 2, W = 3)
	)

plot(do_f)
```

Since $G$ is a pipe, we can ignore simulating $G$ and instead only simulate $F$.
We'll simulate this intervention by controlling for the value of $F$ and using
the posterior samples to calculate the values of $W$ for each $F$.

```{r}
# Setup
N <- 1e3
set.seed(1234819084)

# Extract the posterior samples
post <- rethinking::extract.samples(f_on_w_total, n = N)

# Values of F to simulate
f_vec <- seq(0, 1.5, 0.01)

# Container for results
out <- matrix(nrow = N, ncol = length(f_vec))

# Simulate the results
for (i in 1:length(f_vec)) {
	out[, i] <- with(
		post,
		rnorm(N, a + bF * f_vec[[i]], sigma)
	)
}

# Summarize the output matrix
plot(
	NULL,
	xlim = c(0, 1.5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
	xlab = "Manipulated F", ylab = "Simulated W"
)

# for (i in 1:length(f_vec)) {
# 	lines(x = f_vec, y = out[i, ], col = rethinking::col.alpha("black", 0.05))
# }

for (p in c(seq(0.5, 0.9, 0.1), 0.95, 0.99)) {
	interval <- apply(out, 2, rethinking::PI, prob = p)
	rethinking::shade(interval, f_vec)
}

lines(
	x = f_vec, y = colMeans(out),
	type = "l", col = "black", lwd = 3,
)

```

**3.** Infer the **direct** causal effect of adding food $F$ to a territory on the weight $W$ of foxes. In light of your estmiates from this problem and the previous one, what do you think is going on with these foxes?

:::

Based on the DAG, to get the direct causal effect of foxes, we also need to stratify by $G$ in our model. So we will fit that model first.

```{r}
set.seed(100)
f_on_w_direct <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + bF * F + bG * G,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		bF ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		bG ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = D,
	control = list(maxit = 500)
)
f_on_w_direct |> rethinking::coeftab() |> rethinking::coeftab_plot()
```

OK, now let's compare the coefficients of the two models.

```{r}
rethinking::coeftab(f_on_w_total, f_on_w_direct) |>
	rethinking::coeftab_plot(pars  = c("bF", "bG"))
```

So when we only stratify by $F$, we don't see an effect. But when we stratify
by $F$ and $G$, we see an effect of both variables! The optional problem
sort of spoiled this, but it seems like the most likely explanation here is
negative confounding by an unobserved variable. When we don't control for $G$,
the confounder still has a backdoor pathway through to $W$, but when we control
for $G$ and $F$ simultaneously, the backdoor path is closed and the effect of
$U$ will be absorbed into the estimated effects of $F$ and $G$ (as it should
be). So this is an example of a masked relationship.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon=false}

**4.** Suppose there is an unobserved confound that influences $F$ and $G$,
saying $\boxed{U}$. Assuming this is the correct DAG, again estimate both the
total and direct causal effects of $F$ on $W$. What impact does the
unobserved confound have?

:::

I didn't finish this question because I didn't know how, and apparently it is
a trick question because it is not possible to get the total causal effect of
$F$ (since $U$ is unobserved). That makes me feel better. We would estimate
the direct causal effect of $F$ like we already did under this model.
