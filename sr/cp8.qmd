This chapter is a brief introduction to the concept of conditional inference,
focusing on the specific concept of linear interaction in models.

## Chapter notes

* Bullet holes in bombers and propeller scars on manatees -- both are
*conditional on survival*. This is the motivating example for the chapter.
* An *interaction* is a statistical method for modeling interdependence
between two features of a model.
* Using an interaction term in a model is nearly always better than fitting
stratified models.
* In Bayesian models, it's better to use an index-coding approach and have
parameters vary by the level of a categorical variable, rather than using
an indicator-coding approach, which makes assigning priors difficult.
* An *interaction* is also just a slope which is conditional on another
effect -- the value of one variable modifies the effect of the other.
* Linear interactions are symmetrical. If variable $x$ interacts with
variable $y$, then $y$ interacts with $x$. "There is just no way to specify
a simple, linear interaction in which you can say the effect of some
variable $x$ depends on $z$, but the effect of $z$ does not depend upon $x$."
* Continuous interactions are harder to think about as conditional slopes,
because we would need an uncountably infinite number of categories. Instead,
we can think about interactions as nested linear models.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i &= \alpha + \gamma_{W,i}W_i + \beta_S S_i \\
\gamma_{W,i} &= \beta_{W} + \beta_{WS} S_i
\end{aligned}
$$

* We could include nested terms for both variables, but the resultant
model has unidentifiable parameters -- in the final term below, only the
sum $(\beta_{WS} + \beta_{SW})$ can be estimated.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i &= \alpha + \gamma_{W,i}W_i + \gamma_{S,i} S_i \\
\gamma_{W,i} &= \beta_{W} + \beta_{WS} S_i \\
\gamma_{S_i} &= \beta_{S} + \beta_{SW} W_i \\
\therefore \mu_i &= \alpha + \left(\beta_{W} + \beta_{WS} S_i\right)W_i + \left(\beta_{S} + \beta_{SW} W_i\right) S_i \\
&= \alpha + \beta_W W_i + \beta_S S_i + (\beta_{WS} + \beta_{SW}) W_iS_i
\end{aligned}
$$

* The best way to understand interactions is to plot the predictions at multiple
levels of the interacting variables.

## Exercises

### 8E1

(1) Bread dough rises because of yeast and temperature. Yeast amount and
temperature interact to determine how much the bread dough rises.
(2) Education and parents' education could interact to determine higher
income. While people with more education have higher salaries on average,
people who are educated and also have educated parents are likely to have
even higher average salaries at the same level of individual education.
(3) Gasoline and pressing the accelerator make the car go. If you never press
the accelerator, a full tank won't do anything.

### 8E2

Only statement one (Caramelizing onions requires cooking over a low heat and
making sure the onions don't dry out) involves an interaction. Both things
must be true simultaneously, whereas the effects are independent of each
other in the other statements.

### 8E3

Of course all of these models only make sense if we have a correct way to
quantify those variables.

(1) $\text{onion caramelization} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{temperature} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{moisture} + \gamma_{12} \cdot \text{temperature} \cdot \text{moisture}$
(2) $\text{car speed} = \alpha + \beta_2 \cdot \text{number of cylinders} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{fuel injector quality}$
(3) $\text{political beliefs} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{parental beliefs} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{friend beliefs}$
(4) $\text{intelligence} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{sociality} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{manipulable appendages}.$

### 8M1

In the tulips example, we saw that water and shade levels interact to affect
tulip blooms. Tulips need both water and shade to produce blooms; at a low-light
level, the effect of water decreases because no amount of water can replace
the lost light. Similarly, if plants have no water, an adequate amount of
sunlight will not produce blooms and might even become harmful.

If the hot temperature prevents blooms all together, then the hot temperature
would modify the effect of shade, water, and their interaction to all become
zero -- no amount of shade or water can allow for blooms, and their interaction
does not help in this context either.

### 8M2

The linear model for the tulips example without heat was
$$
\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_W W_i + \beta_S S_i + \gamma_{SW} S_iW_i.
$$

We can make all of those terms dependent on $H_i$, the heat treatment, in order
to accomplish this.

$$
\mu_i = \alpha_{H[i]} + \beta^{W}_{H[i]} + \beta^S_{H[i]} + \gamma^{SW}_{H[i]} S_iW_i.
$$

Now it is possible for these effects to all be zero (or much smaller)
if $H[i] = 1$, and have
their normal values if $H[i] = 0$. Another way to write this model could
be something like
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i &= \lambda_i (1 - H_i) \\
\lambda_i &= \alpha + \beta_W W_i + \beta_S S_i + \gamma_{SW} S_iW_i
\end{aligned}
$$
where $H_i$ again takes on values of $0$ (cold) and $1$ (hot).

### 8M3

We cannot create a data set where the raven population and wolf population
have a linear statistical interaction, because a linear statistical
interaction has at least two predictors. Here we only have an outcome
(the raven population size) and a predictor (the wolf population size). This is
more of an example of a differential equations type problem than a statistical
interaction. In this model, the raven population size would have to vary
with the wolf population size, and we do not know about the functional
form of this effect, so an appropriate model would be something like

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = f\left(W(t)\right),
$$
where $f$ is a function that takes the wolf population size at time $t$ as an
input, and returns the change in the raven population before the next
time point.

### 8M4

We'll use the sample model for the tulip blooms without heat from the
[earlier exercise](###8M2). The priors used in the chapter were

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0.5, 0.25) \\
\beta_W &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.25) \\
\beta_S &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.25) \\
\gamma_{SW} &\sim \text{Normal}(0, 0.25) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We want to use new priors that constrain the effect of water to be positive and
the effect of shade to be negative. At this point in the book, the
distribution we learned about that has to be positive is lognormal, and
we can force the effect of shade to be negative by taking the additive inverse
of a lognormal prior. Since we know that having more water increases the effect
of light (because if a tulip has plenty of water, getting enough sunshine is
the new limiting factor on the blooms), we know that having more water should
decrease the effect of shade, so we'll make the interaction negative as well.
Lognormal priors can be hard to calibrate, so we'll adjust the parameters
until the prior predictive simulation looks nice. The priors we'll use are
as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_W W_i - \beta_S S_i - \gamma_{SW} S_iW_i \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(0.5, 0.25) \\
\beta_W &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1) \\
\beta_S &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1) \\
\gamma_{SW} &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r}
set.seed(370)

# Load the data
data(tulips)
d <- tulips
d$blooms_std <- d$blooms / max(d$blooms)
d$water_cent <- d$water - mean(d$water)
d$shade_cent <- d$shade - mean(d$shade)

# Fit the model and extract the prior samples
m_8m4 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		blooms_std ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + bw * water_cent - bs * shade_cent - bws * water_cent * shade_cent,
		a ~ dnorm(0.5, 0.25),
		bw  ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		bs  ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		bws ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)

prior <- rethinking::extract.prior(m_8m4)

# Plot the prpd
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
for (s in -1:1) {
	idx <- which(d$shade_cent == s)
	plot(
		d$water_cent[idx],
		d$blooms_std[idx],
		xlim = c(-1, 1),
		ylim = c(-0.5, 1.5),
		xlab = "water",
		ylab = "blooms",
		pch = 16,
		col = rethinking::rangi2
	)
	abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
	abline(h = 1, lty = 2)
	mtext(paste0("shade = ", s))
	mu <- rethinking::link(
		m_8m4,
		data = data.frame(shade_cent = s, water_cent = -1:1),
		post = prior
	)
	for (i in 1:20) lines(-1:1, mu[i, ], col = col.alpha("black", 0.3))
}
```

I did a few different simulations and ultimately ended up with the prior
simulation shown here. The slope priors are regularizing and skeptical,
so we think that a smaller effect is more likely *a priori* -- if the effects
are large, the data can demonstrate that for us.

### 8H1

Now we want to add the *bed* variable to the tulips example, which we'll
denote with $B_i$. We only want to include the bed effect as a main effect,
which means we need to have a different intercept for each bed -- so our
model will assume that each bed can start at a different baseline, but the
effects of water, shade, and their interaction, are homogeneous across the
beds. This is probably an OK assumption in the context of a controlled
greenhouse setting.

The model will be as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim \text{Normal} \left(\mu_i, \sigma\right) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha_{B[i]} + \beta_W W_i - \beta_S S_i - \gamma_{SW} S_iW_i \\
\alpha_{B[i]} &\sim \text{Normal}(0.5, 0.25) \\
\beta_W &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1) \\
\beta_S &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1) \\
\gamma_{SW} &\sim \text{Log-normal}(-3, 1) \\
\sigma &\sim \text{Exponential}(1)
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, we'll use the same constrained, regularizing priors, as we did for the
previous problem, but we'll have a separate intercept for each bed. In reality,
it would probably be good to have the intercept parameters be correlated as
well, but we haven't gone over that in the book yet. Let's go ahead and fit the
model.

```{r}
set.seed(370)
# For the index coding to work, we need a numeric version of the beds.
d$b <- as.integer(d$bed)

# Fit the model
m_8h1 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		blooms_std ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a[b] + bw * water_cent - bs * shade_cent -
			bws * water_cent * shade_cent,
		a[b] ~ dnorm(0.5, 0.25),
		bw  ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		bs  ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		bws ~ dlnorm(-3, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)

rethinking::precis(m_8h1, depth = 2)
```

From the precis, we can see that the first bed (bed 1, with parameter `a[1]`)
has a lower intercept than the other two beds -- maybe this bed is next to
a drafty space, is the first bed in the water connection and gets the pipe
sludge, or just had less bloomds for some reason. But after we account for
the different baselines between beds, the estimates of the parameter effects
are similar to the last model, so this should just improve the accuracy of
our model predictions for the first bed. We can plot the predictions to see.

```{r}
# Plot the prpd
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

cols <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73")

for (s in -1:1) {
	idx <- which(d$shade_cent == s)
	plot(
		d$water_cent[idx],
		d$blooms_std[idx],
		xlim = c(-1, 1),
		ylim = c(-0.5, 1.5),
		xlab = "water",
		ylab = "blooms",
		pch = 16,
		col = cols[d$b[idx]]
	)
	abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
	abline(h = 1, lty = 2)
	mtext(paste0("shade = ", s))
	
	for (bd in 1:3) {
		mu <- rethinking::link(
			m_8h1,
			data = data.frame(shade_cent = s, water_cent = -1:1, b = bd)
		)
		for (i in 1:20) {
			lines(
				-1:1, mu[i, ],
				col = col.alpha(cols[bd], 0.3)
			)
		}
	}
}

legend("topright", c("Bed a", "Bed b", "Bed c"), col = cols, lty = 1)
```

While it's actually quite difficult to make statistical conclusions without
multiple replicates (here we have only one measurement per bed per treatment),
we can see the clear difference between bed a and the other two beds in the
model predictions. However, it also appears that our model predictions may
not capture the true effect, as from the observed data it seems plausible that
the effects of water and shade vary across beds. We would need actual
replicates to be more certain of that, though.

### 8H2

Now we can compare the models with and without bed using WAIC.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m_8m4, m_8h1)
```

We see that the WAIC is smaller for the model with bed included, although
the difference is small. This implies that adding the bed variable as a main
effect increases the accuracy of our posterior predictions, although the
improvement is not spectacular. As we saw by looking at summaries of the
posterior distribution in the previous exercise, the difference in the estimated
intercept for bed A vs. bed b and bed c, without any major changes in the
estimates of the slope parameters, should account for this difference.

### 8H3

For this question, we'll focus on the `ruggedness` data.

```{r}
data("rugged")
# Repeating data processing steps from the book
d <- rugged
d$log_gdp <- log(d$rgdppc_2000)
dd <- d[complete.cases(d$rgdppc_2000), ]
dd$log_gdp_std <- dd$log_gdp / mean(dd$log_gdp)
dd$rugged_std <- dd$rugged / max(dd$rugged)

dd$cid <- ifelse(dd$cont_africa == 1, 1, 2)
```

Now we need to recreate model `m8.5` from the chapter. Well, at least that's
what the book says to do, but model `m8.5` is about the tulips example, so
we'll recreate `m8.3` instead.

```{r}
m8.3 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		log_gdp_std ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a[cid] + b[cid] * (rugged_std - 0.215),
		a[cid] ~ dnorm(1, 0.1),
		b[cid] ~ dnorm(0, 0.3),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = dd
)
rethinking::precis(m8.3, depth = 2)
```

We got similar results to what's in the book, which is good. Now we want to
examine the model with PSIS to determine if the Seychelles are influential
on the estimation of parameters for the Africa group.

```{r}
set.seed(370)
m8.3_psis <- rethinking::PSIS(m8.3, pointwise = TRUE, n = 20000)
rownames(m8.3_psis) <- dd$isocode
psis_sort <- m8.3_psis[order(m8.3_psis$k, decreasing = TRUE), ]
psis_sort |> head()
```

The most influential country on the model fit, judging by the Pareto $k$ values,
are Lesotho and the Seychelles, which are both highly rugged nations in Africa.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
dd_sorted <- dd[order(m8.3_psis$k, decreasing = TRUE), ]
plot(
	dd_sorted$rugged_std, psis_sort$k,
	xlab = "Ruggedness as prop. of maximum",
	ylab = "PSIS Pareto k value"
)
```

We can see that highly rugged nations have the largest Pareto $k$ values,
indicating that they are the most influential variables. We also know that
these values have a high leverage in a linear regression model, so that makes
sense.

Now that we know these nations with high ruggedness are having an oversized
effect on the estimated trend, we can try to use robust regression to
lower their influence. We'll use the same model, but with a Student's $t$
distribution likelihood (with 2 d.f.) instead of a Normal likelihood. Personally
I prefer 3 degrees of freedom (the variance of the distribution is infinite if
the d.f. is not larger than 2, which is a prior belief that never makes sense
in a physical context to me), but for now I'll do what the textbook says.

```{r}
m8.3_r <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		log_gdp_std ~ dstudent(nu = 2, mu, sigma),
		mu <- a[cid] + b[cid] * (rugged_std - 0.215),
		a[cid] ~ dnorm(1, 0.1),
		b[cid] ~ dnorm(0, 0.3),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = dd
)
rethinking::precis(m8.3_r, depth = 2)
```

We can see by comparing the two model summaries that a few of the
parameters are slightly different. Let's now compare the models using PSIS.

```{r}
set.seed(12312)
rethinking::compare(m8.3, m8.3_r, func = PSIS, n = 20000)
```

Here, we can see that the non-robust model actually appears to be giving us
worse predictions than the non-robust model. However, we know that PSIS is
just a measure of predictive performance, so it's possible that our
robust model is still a better conceptual model that provides more accurate
inferences at the cost of appearing to underfit the data. Since the
two models have every similar numbers of parameters, predictive accuracy
criteria are likely to be more sensitive to this kind of "underfitting", when
we actually know outside of the statistics world that we're reducing the
impact of outlying values.

Anyways, we can also look at the individual pareto $k$ values for the new
model.

```{r}
set.seed(370)
m8.3r_psis <- rethinking::PSIS(m8.3_r, pointwise = TRUE, n = 20000)
rownames(m8.3r_psis) <- dd$isocode
psis_sort_r <- m8.3r_psis[order(m8.3r_psis$k, decreasing = TRUE), ]
psis_sort_r |> head()
```

Now we can see that the pareto $k$ values are all much lower. While Lesotho
still appears in the top 6, it is overall much less influential, and Seychelles
no longer appears in the top 6.

### 8H4

For this problem, we'll use the `nettle` data to examine the hypothesis
that higher food security leads to a higher language diversity in a region.

First we need to construct the outcome variable.

```{r}
data(nettle)
d <- nettle
d$lang.per.cap <- d$num.lang / d$k.pop

# The log of this will be our actual outcome variable
d$log.lang.per.cap <- log10(d$lang.per.cap)

# Center the outcome
ybar <- mean(d$log.lang.per.cap)
d$std.log.lang.per.cap <- d$log.lang.per.cap - ybar

# We also need the log of the area
d$log.area <- log10(d$area)
```

Since I don't really know anything about this problem other than what the
textbook tells me, I'll follow the specified steps. The effects we want to
evaluate here are the effects of `mean.growing.season`, which we'll call $M$,
and `sd.growing.season`, on our model. We also need to consider $A$, the log of
`area`, as a potential cause. I'm not sure how we would work in the number of
weather stations in our model, so for now we'll leave that alone -- although
there is a noticeable trend in the data that as the number of measurement
stations increased, so did the SD of the growing season length. So in a real
academic paper, we would definitely need to think about how to model that.

First let's look at the bivariate relationship between each of these values and
the outcome.

```{r}
layout(matrix(c(1, 2, 3), nrow = 1))
plot(
	d$mean.growing.season, d$log.lang.per.cap,
	xlab = "Mean length of growing season (months)",
	ylab = "log10 number of langauges per capita"
)
plot(
	d$sd.growing.season, d$log.lang.per.cap,
	xlab = "Standard deviation of length of growing season (months)",
	ylab = ""
)
plot(
	d$log.area, d$log.lang.per.cap,
	xlab = "log10 area of country (sq. km.)",
	ylab = ""
)
```

In general, none of these trends looks particularly strong, although
there appear to be some trends with the growing season variables.

Now, let's try to fit a simple model that models the log languages per
capita based on the mean length of the growing season. We'll use a normal
likelihood since the outcome variable is on the log scale. Since we aren't
using a count model, which would naturally constrict the domain of the
outcome variable, I also chose to center the outcome variable before
modeling to make assigning a prior for the intercept feasible.

For the intercept, we'll use a generic prior centered at 0 (the mean after
standardization). For the effect of the mean growing season length, we'll
use a regularizing, skeptical prior centered around 0.

```{r}
# Set seed for all of our models in this section
set.seed(370)
m_mgs <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		std.log.lang.per.cap ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b_mgsl * mean.growing.season,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b_mgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)
rethinking::precis(m_mgs)
```

We can see from the summary that there is a small prior effect of mean
growing season length on the outcome. Now, let's check whether the
area should be a coefficient in this model as well.

```{r}
m_mgs_a <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		std.log.lang.per.cap ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b_mgsl * mean.growing.season + b_area * log.area,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b_mgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_area ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)
rethinking::precis(m_mgs_a)
```

The effect of the area variable is negative and a large amount of the
density lies below zero, which suggests that the area could be a real effect that
we need to control for. Controlling for the area size also affects out estimate
of the effect of mean growing season length. Let's compare the models via WAIC
and see if the area improves posterior predictions.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m_mgs, m_mgs_a)
```

The WAICs are extremely similar, and the WAIC for the model without area
is slightly better, so I don't think we need area in this model. If we think
about the problem casually, I don't understand why the area would be a
confounder or a collider in this situation, because the area doesn't
casually determine the mean growing season length in a country. However, larger
countries should have more variation in the growing season length (since larger
area overall means they can cover more areas of varying latitude).
But, I think that a larger area should mean there is more room for multiple
communities to exist and become isolated, so a larger country should also have
more languages on average.

So I think the DAG should look something like this.

```{r}
layout(c(1))
dag <- dagitty::dagitty(
	'DAG {
	"languages" <- "mean length"
	"languages" <- "SD length" <- "area"
	"languages" <- "area"
	}'
)
coordinates(dag) <- list(
	x = c("languages" = 0, "mean length" = 1, "SD length" = -1, "area" = -1),
	y = c("languages" = 0, "mean length" = 0, "SD length" = 0.5, "area" = -0.5)
)
plot(dag)
```

So, in our final model we'll need to include area anyways, so we might as
well leave it in there for now.

Next we want to examine the effect of the SD of growing season length on
languages. The `area` variable is a confounder in this casual structure, so
we need to include that as well to avoid getting a biased estimate.

```{r}
m_sgs_a <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		std.log.lang.per.cap ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b_sgsl * sd.growing.season + b_area * log.area,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b_sgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_area ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)
rethinking::precis(m_sgs_a)
```

We see that the SD of growing season length does appear to have a negative
effective on the overall number of languages. We cannot rule out entirely
the lack of an effect (assuming our causal structure is correct and
linear models are appropriate), but there is likely to be a negative
effect of the SD of growing length on number of languages.

So far we've seen that an average longer growing season leads to more languages
per capita, meaning that more food abundance leads to smaller, more isolated
social groups and the development of more languages. However, higher variation
in the growing season length leads to lower languages per capita, suggesting
the need to form larger social networks for insurance against short growing
seasons. In both models, we saw a negative effect of area, indicating that
as a country becomes larger, the number of languages becomes smaller, which
is the opposite of what I would have thought. Perhaps larger countries, on
average, have shorter growing seasons? We can examine that effect quickly.

```{r}
layout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1))
plot(
	d$mean.growing.season, d$log.area,
	xlab = "Mean length of growing season (months)",
	ylab = "log10 area of country (sq. km.)"
)
plot(
	d$sd.growing.season, d$log.area,
	xlab = "Standard deviation of length of growing season (months)",
	ylab = ""
)
```

Interestingly, we can see slight patterns in both trends. Larger countries
seem to have slightly smaller average growing seasons, and more uncertainty
in their growing seasons. I think the effect on the mean length of the
growing season is quite small, and is likely to not be causal, although we
could postulate that larger countries tend to cover more sparsely inhabited
territory which has a shorter growing season. There is a definite trend in the
standard deviation of the growing season though -- it's hard to tell if this
is an effect of covering more latitude areas, or a function of a number of
measuring systems. We would need a variable on the range of latitude covered
by each country to disentangle those effects.

Anyways, now we can fit the main model. We'll fit two models that include all
three variables. One will include just main effects, and the other will include
an interaction between the effects of mean and SD of growing season length.
Then we can compare those models.

```{r}
m_noint <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		std.log.lang.per.cap ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b_sgsl * sd.growing.season + b_mgsl * mean.growing.season +
			b_area * log.area,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b_mgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_sgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_area ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)

rethinking::precis(m_noint)
```

After including both the mean and SD of growing season length in the
model, the effect of area goes away. This suggests that the effect of area on
the number of languages per capita is completely explained by the
effect of the growing season -- we have no evidence here for a direct causal
effect of area, meaning that more room for expansion doesn't say anything about
the number of languages we expect to see, unless we know how habitable the
land is first. In this model, we see a positive effect of the mean and
negative effect of the SD as we expect. Now we can look at a possible
interaction.

```{r}
m_int <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		std.log.lang.per.cap ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + b_sgsl * sd.growing.season + b_mgsl * mean.growing.season +
			b_intr * mean.growing.season * sd.growing.season + b_area * log.area,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 5),
		b_mgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_sgsl ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_intr ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		b_area ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d
)

rethinking::precis(m_int)
```

It certainly looks like the results are different, which is qualitatively
important to understand. But let's first check the WAIC to get an idea of
how much better our interaction model is doing.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m_noint, m_int)
```

OK, it's only a bit better in terms of predictive accuracy, but the estimates
are so different that we need to try and understand what's going on here.

When we include an interaction term, the effect of the standard deviation on its
own largely goes away, and the effect of the negative is negative with almost
all of the probability mass below 0. This suggests that by itself, the SD
is not important for determining the number of languages -- we need to know
the mean first. I think we need to make a plot to really understand this
effect.

```{r}
# Plot the prpd
layout(matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))

sd_vals <- c(0, 1.5, 3, 4.5)
sample_n <- 500
ncolors <- 10
cols <- viridisLite::plasma(ncolors)
rank <- as.factor(as.numeric(cut(d$sd.growing.season, ncolors)))

for (i in 1:length(sd_vals)) {
	sd <- sd_vals[i]
	idx <- which(dplyr::between(d$sd.growing.season, sd - 1.5, sd + 1.5))
	plot(
		#d$mean.growing.season[idx],
		#d$log.lang.per.cap[idx],
		NULL, NULL,
		xlim = c(0, 12),
		ylim = 10 ^ c(-4, 0),
		xaxs = "i",
		yaxs = "i",
		xlab = "Mean growing season length (months)",
		ylab = "Number of languages per capita",
		pch = 16,
		log = "y"
		#col = cols[rank[idx]]
	)
	mtext(paste0("SD of growing season = ", sd))
	
	# Calculate the posterior values
	post_data <- expand.grid(
		mean.growing.season = seq(0, 12, 0.1),
		sd.growing.season = sd,
		log.area = mean(d$log.area)
	)
	
	mu <- rethinking::link(m_int, post_data, n = sample_n)
	
	for (i in 1:sample_n) {
		lines(
			seq(0, 12, 0.1), 10 ^ (mu[i, ] + ybar),
			col = col.alpha("black", 0.1)
		)
	}
}
```

From the posterior predictions, we can understand the effect of the interaction
a lot easier. The posterior predictions shown all use the average value of the
log land area, but the main thing we want to understand here is the qualitative
way the effect changes. When the SD value is small (the points shown in the
top right panel are from 0 to 1.5), there is little variation in the length
of the growing season, and the effect of the average length of the growing
season on language diversity is positive. However, as the variation in
growing season length increases, the effect becomes smaller and then negative,
indicating that for highly variable areas, there is little effect of the
average growing season on language diversity. For extremely variable areas,
a long growing season may even lead to less language diversity, but we do
not have enough data to say that conclusively.


### 8H5

For this exercise, we'll build a model using the `Wines2012` dataset.

```{r}
data("Wines2012")
d <- Wines2012
```

It looks like the wines are scores out of 20, so normally I would recommend
a binomial (or beta-binomial) model here. But we don't know that for sure
and we haven't learned that yet, so we'll standardize the scores and
model the $z$-scores instead. This is a fairly interesting problem even
with the small amount of data we have, and I imagine will make quite an
interesting multilevel modeling problem later in the book.

For this question, we just need to include effects of the judge and of the
wine.

```{r}
dd <- data.frame(
	y = rethinking::standardize(d$score),
	j = rethinking::coerce_index(d$judge),
	w = rethinking::coerce_index(d$wine),
	wine_amer = d$wine.amer,
	judge_amer = d$judge.amer,
	red = as.integer(ifelse(d$flight == "red", 1, 0))
)
dplyr::glimpse(dd)
```

First we can try to visualize the data. It's a bit difficult because we have
two categorical variables and one continuous (perfect two-way anova design),
but we can make two plots to try and see what's going on.

```{r}
d$j2 <- rethinking::coerce_index(d$judge) |> factor()
p1 <-
	ggplot(d) +
	aes(x = wine, y = score) +
	geom_point() +
	facet_wrap(~j2) +
	hgp::theme_ms() +
	theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8, angle = 90))

p2 <-
	ggplot(d) +
	aes(x = j2, y = score) +
	geom_point() +
	facet_wrap(~wine) +
	hgp::theme_ms() +
	theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10)) + labs(x = "judge")

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

Of course with data like these we just kind of have to eyeball them and make
qualitative guesses as to what might be going on. But In general we can
see there are some nicer judges (5, 3), and some meaner judges (4, 9), and
one judge that got meaner as they tried more wines (8). However, most of the
wines look fairly similar with the exception of a few like C2 and I2 that
appeared to get worse bad reviews. I guess if we were following Agresti's
*Categorical Data Analysis* the next thing to do would be to get marginal
and conditional mean scores, but we don't need to do that now, we can
start fitting models (which does that in an easier way, more or less).

We'll use (as usual) a normal likelihood -- a $t$-likelihood might be better
if some of our judges or wines give outlying scores, but for now we'll
ignore that possibility. Next we need to assign priors. Fortunately for
us this is easy and I'll just assign a typical normal prior, I'm not too
sure why it really needs to be justified. So let's go ahead and fit the
first model.

```{r}
set.seed(12312)
m_w1 <- rethinking::quap(
	flist = alist(
		y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a_w[w] + a_j[j],
		a_w[w] ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		a_j[j] ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = dd
)

layout(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow = 1))
rethinking::precis(m_w1, depth = 2, pars = paste0("a_w[", 1:20, "]")) |>
	precis_plot()
mtext("Wine parameters")
rethinking::precis(m_w1, depth = 2, pars = paste0("a_j[", 1:9, "]")) |>
	precis_plot()
mtext("Judge parameters")
```

Like we thought from looking at the plots, the judges appear to be more
different from each other than the wines are. We probably also want to know
about how the judges and wines interact, but since we don't have any replicates,
we can't really get good answers for that question, all we can do is look
at the score in each cell.

```{r}
ggplot(d) +
	aes(x = wine, y = judge, fill = score) +
	geom_tile() +
	scale_fill_viridis_c(breaks = c(7, 10, 15, 19), limits = c(7, 19.5)) +
	hgp::theme_ms() +
	guides(fill = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 15))
```

### 8H6

Now instead of looking at the variability across judges and across wines, we
want to try and use the characteristics of the judges and wines to understand
the scores. For this problem, we won't include any interactions. Again,
we'll use standard priors, and the variables we'll include as main effects are
`flight` (whether the wine is red or white), `wine.amer` (if the wine was
made in America), and `judge.amer` (whether the judge is American).

For whatever reason, the book says to use indicator coding for this problem and
the next problem (coding interactions between two categorical variables
is annoying somehow, I tried it and couldn't figure it out). So we'll do that.

```{r}
m_w2 <-
	rethinking::quap(
		flist = alist(
			y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + a_wa * wine_amer + a_ja * judge_amer + a_red * red,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_wa ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_ja ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_red ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = dd
	)

rethinking::precis(m_w2)
```

Overall, the red and white wines were judged similarly without a large discrepancy
between groups. American judges tended to be more generous, and American wines
tended to be rated slightly worse. However, we have a great deal of uncertainty
about all of these parameters.

### 8H7

Apparently doing the interactions IS the reason for using indicator coding
here, quap I guess can't handle all the stuff that Stan can. Now we want
to include all of the third-level interactions that we can make.

```{r}
m_w3 <-
	rethinking::quap(
		flist = alist(
			y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
			mu <- a + a_wa * wine_amer + a_ja * judge_amer + a_red * red +
				# American wine/american judge
				g_wawj * wine_amer * judge_amer +
				# American red wines
				g_rwa * wine_amer * red +
				# Red wines / american judge
				g_rja * judge_amer * red,
			a ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_wa ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_ja ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			a_red ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			g_wawj ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			g_rwa ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			g_rja ~ dnorm(0, 2),
			sigma ~ dexp(1)
		),
		data = dd
	)

rethinking::precis(m_w3, depth = 2)
```

Usually I hate looking at tables, but this one is not too bad because the
trend is pretty obvious. All of the parameters are zero-ish (lots of
probably mass on either side of 0), except for one, which is `g_rwa`. This is
the interaction term between American wines and red wines -- so it looks like
American red wines were much worse on average than non-american and/or non-red
wines.

In the solutions guide, Richard actually gives a good reason for using more
skeptical priors for the interaction terms than on the main effect terms.
I need to remember that for the future.
