Predictive accuracy is the main focus of this chapter. The titular metaphor
"Ulysses' compass" refers to the mythological hero Ulysses navigating the
path between the two monsters Charybdis and Scylla, who each lived on
either side of a narrow strait. Sailors attempting to avoid Charybdis would
sail too close to Scylla, and vice versa. McElreath likens this to the scientist
navigating between underfitting and overfitting. Major topics of this chapter
include out-of-sample predictive accuracy estimation via LOOCV, PSIS, and WAIC;
regularizing priors; and the prediction/inference trade-off.

## Chapter notes

* When we think about Copernicus and the heliocentric model, we have to remember
that the geocentric model makes very good predictions, despite being wrong.
Models that are completely causally wrong can make great predictions.
* The principle of parsimony is often used to distinguish between models which
make good predictions, but even this is not always useful for us in science.
* $R^2$ is a commonly used method for choosing the "best" regression model,
but even this is not correct. In general, overfitting and underfitting are
both dangerous and we must be wary of methods which can lead us to overfit.
The notion of overfitting and underfitting is related to the bias-variance
tradeoff.
* To construct useful measures in a Bayesian framework, we need to consider the
entropy of our models -- that is, how much is our uncertainty reduced if we
learn an outcome? The information entropy is the function
$$h(p) = -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \cdot \log(p_i).$$
* We can relate the entropy of the model to the accuracy of our predictions
using the **Kullback-Leibler divergence**: the additional uncertainty induced by
using probabilities from one distribution to describe another. The divergence
is given by
$$D_{KL}(p, q) = \sum_i p_i \log \left( \frac{p_i}{q_i}\right).$$
* Using the divergence, or the related deviance,
we cannot estimate how close a model is to the truth. However, we can tell
which of a set of models is closest to the truth, and how much better it is from
the others.
* We estimate the deviance as $-2 \times \texttt{lppd}$ where $\texttt{lppd}$ is
the *log pointwise predictive density*. The formula is omitted here but is on
page 210 of the book.
* Importantly, we cannot simply score models on the data used to fit the models,
because this leads to overfitting.
* We can often use regularizing priors, which are skeptical and try to prevent
the model from taking on extreme values, to improve our out-of-sample performance.
* The traditional way to approximate out-of-sample error is by using
Cross-Validation, specifically Leave-One-Out CV (LOOCV).
* Since LOOCV is computationally very expensive, we want to approximate it. One
method is called Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), and another is
called the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC). See the text, section
7.4 for details on both methods.
* As a sidenote, this chapter discusses robust regression using a $t$ likelihood
instead of a Gaussian likelihood on page 233.
* I really enjoyed the metaphor that "if we search hard enough, we are bound
to found a Curse of Tippicanoe" -- if we torture the data enough, it will
confess.

## Exercises

### 7E1

The three motivating criteria which define information entropy are

1. Entropy should be a continuous-valued function;
1. As the size of the sample space increases, entropy should increase for
events that are equally likely; and
1. If the entropy associated with the event $E_1$ is $h_1$ and the entropy
associated with the event $E_2$ is $h_2$, then the entropy associated with the
event $E_1 \cup E_2$ should be $h_1 + h_2$.

### 7E2

If a coin is weighted such that when the coin is flipped, the probability of
heads is $70\%$ is given by
$$h = -\left( 0.7 \cdot \log(0.7) + 0.3 \cdot \log(0.3) \right) \approx 0.61,$$
because the only other possibility is that the coin lands on tails, which occurs
with probability $0.3$.

### 7E3

Suppose that a four-sided die is weighted so that each possible outcome occurs
with the frequency given in the following table.

| _roll_ | _p_  |
|--------|------|
| 1      | 0.20 |
| 2      | 0.25 |
| 3      | 0.25 |
| 4      | 0.30 |

The entropy is then
$$h = -\sum_{i = 1}^4 p_i \cdot \log p_i \approx 1.38.$$

### 7E4

Suppose we have another 4-sided die when the sides 1, 2, and 3 occur equally
often but the side 4 never occurs. If $X$ is the random variable representing
the result of the die roll, we calculate the entropy over the support of $X$,
which is $S(X) = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and we leave the value of 4 out of the calculation
entirely. The entropy is then

$$h = -3\left( \frac{1}{3}\cdot\log\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx 1.10.$$

### 7M1

The definition of the AIC is
$$\mathrm{AIC} = -2(\mathrm{lppd} - p),$$
while the definition of the WAIC is
$$\mathrm{WAIC} = -2 \left(\mathrm{lppd} - \sum_i \mathrm{var}_{\theta}\left( \log p(y_i\mid\theta)\right)\right).$$

Both of these formulas involve comparing the lppd to some penalty term,
which is more general for the WAIC than for the AIC. In order for the AIC
to be similar to the WAIC, we need to make assumptions which lead to
the equivalence
$$ p = \sum_i \mathrm{var}_{\theta}\left( \log p(y_i\mid\theta)\right), $$
on average.

According to the text, this will occur if we assume that the
priors are flat (or are overwhelmed by the likelihood), the posterior
distribution is approximately multivariate Gaussian, and the sample size
is much greater than the number of parameters. So for models with
complicated, hierarchical likelihoods, which are common in actual research
questions, the AIC will likely not be a good approximation to the WAIC,
and unfortunately the AIC gives us no diagnostic criteria to determine when
it fails.

### 7M2

Model *selection* concerns selecting one model out of a group and
discarding the others. Typically one would use the remaining model to make
inferences or predictions. However, model *comparison* involves investigating
the differences between multiple models, including comparing the criterion
values and comparing the estimates and predictions. When we choose to do
selection rather than comparison, we lose all of the information encoded
in the differences between the model -- knowing which differences in models
change criterion values and estimates is crucial information which can inform
our understanding of the system.

### 7M3

We need to fit models to the exact same set of data points in order to compare
them based on WAIC because changing the data points will change the WAIC even
if nothing about the model changes. If we were to use the same number of data
points, but different sets of data, the WAIC will fluctuate based on properties
of the data, and we could get different results when we compare the same
models.

The penalty parameter of the WAIC also depends on the value of $N$, the number
of data points. If we were to drop data points (for example, due to missing
data in some models, but not others), we would expect the WAIC to increase
(become worse)
because we have less information relative to the complexity of the models.
Conversely, if we increased the number of data points the WAIC could be
better just because of that. We could then make an incorrect decision by
comparing the WAICs from models fit on different data.

### 7M4

As the width of the priors decreases (i.e. the priors become more concentrated), the WAIC penalty term shrinks. The WAIC penalty term is based
on the variances of individual probability estimates across samples. As the
width of a prior is narrowed, the model will tend to produce samples for
each individual that are closer together on average and thus the penalty term
will decrease. However, since the `lppd` also changes when we change the
priors we cannot say for sure whether this increases or decreases the overall
WAIC.

### 7M5

When we use informative priors, we make the model more skeptical of extreme
values in the data, and less trustworthy of values that would pull the model
away from the priors. The data thus need to contain a large amount of evidence
to make extreme values more likely in the posterior distribution. Under these
conditions, the model is "excited" less by the training sample -- and thus,
the model fitting process is more robust to variations in the training sample
due to sample error. Ideally, the model will capture less of the noise in the
data while still capturing strong underlying trends, improving the performance
of the model at explaining novel data from the same data generating process.

### 7M6

Overly informative priors, or in the worst case, degenerate priors, will
dominate the model and prevent the model from learning from the data. If
a prior is too narrow, the data cannot provide enough evidence to move the
model away from the priors. Such a model is so skeptical of the data that it
does not pick up the noise from sampling variability in the data, nor does it
pick up any signal from the underlying trends either. Because the model has
learned nothing from the data, we could make predictions just as good by
making up random numbers.

### 7H1

For this exercise, we want to fit a curve to the `Laffer` data. First let's
load and plot the data. Note that I've gone ahead and standardized the
independent variable, tax rate.

```{r}
data(Laffer)
d <- list(
	x = standardize(Laffer$tax_rate),
	y = Laffer$tax_revenue
)

plot(
	d,
	xlab = "Standardized tax rate",
	ylab = "Tax revenue"
)
```

For this exercise, I'll fit three models to the data: a regular linear model, a
quadratic polynomial model, and a cubic polynomial model. For a real research
question, I would also probably consider a spline model, but that is too much
work for no payoff here. I messed around for a bit and tried to get a model like
the curve from the image in the book, but that is laughably wrong and impossible
to fit, so it didn't work out.

```{r}
set.seed(123123)
m1 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + b1 * x,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b1 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(0.5)
	),
	data = d
)
m2 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + b1 * x + b2 * I(x ^ 2),
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b1 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b2 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(0.5)
	),
	data = d
)
m3 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + b1 * x + b2 * I(x ^ 2) + b3 * I(x ^ 3),
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b1 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b2 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b3 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(0.5)
	),
	data = d
)
```

The first thing we probably want to do is plot the predictions of these
models.

```{r}
x_m <- attr(d$x, "scaled:center")
x_s <- attr(d$x, "scaled:scale")
x_vec <- list(x = seq(min(d$x), max(d$x), length.out = 500))
x_tf <- x_vec$x * x_s + x_m

plot(
	x = d$x * x_s + x_m,
	y = d$y,
	xlab = "Tax rate",
	ylab = "Tax revenue"
)

m1_post <- rethinking::link(m1, data = x_vec) |> colMeans()
lines(
	x = x_tf, y = m1_post,
	lty = 1, col = "black",
	lwd = 2
)

m2_post <- rethinking::link(m2, data = x_vec) |> colMeans()
lines(
	x = x_tf, y = m2_post,
	lty = 2, col = "blue",
	lwd = 2
)

m3_post <- rethinking::link(m3, data = x_vec) |> colMeans()
lines(
	x = x_tf, y = m3_post,
	lty = 3, col = "red",
	lwd = 2
)

legend(
	x = "topleft",
	legend = c("Linear", "Quadratic", "Cubic"),
	col = c("black", "blue", "red"),
	lty = c(1, 2, 3),
	lwd = c(2, 2, 2)
)
```

OK, so we can first of all see that none of those models are even anywhere
close to what that editorial showed. None of them really get pulled towards
the point with the high tax revenue, but we'll check that better in the
next question. The next thing that we need to do is compare the models. First
let's check the WAIC.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m1, m2, m3)
```

All of the models appear to perform about the same. So even though the linear
model had technically the lowest WAIC, it's probably preferable to use that
model since the gains in performance are smaller than the standard errors of
the WAIC estimates. Let's check PSIS as well.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m1, m2, m3, func = "PSIS")
```

We'll address the issues with the high Pareto $k$ values in the next question.
For now we can see that model 1, the linear model, has the lowest PSIS, although
again we can see that the standard errors are much higher than the differences
in performance. But since we have few data points, adopting the simpler model
will likely be a better choice and it seems that there is some linear
relationship between tax revenue and tax rate. Let's look at the model summary
for `m1`.

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

We see that, on average, we would expect for a 1 standard deviation increase
in the tax rate, we would expect the tax revenue to increase by 1 unit, whatever
those units are (I didn't look them up). Almost all of the probability mass
is above zero, so even if the quantitative effect value is somewhat larger
or stronger, we can be reasonably confident that increasing the tax rate will
increase the tax revenue by some amount.

### 7H2

This question tells us that there is an outlier, but based on the previous
Pareto $k$ values that I already glanced at (not all listed out here), that
seems to be correct. Point #12 is identified as incredibly influential in all
three models (along with point 1 for the quadratic model, giving us another
reason to trust that model less than the linear model regardless of what the
WAIC tells us). Because of the outlier, we'll refit the linear model using
a Student's $t$ regression and see what happens.

```{r}
m4 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		y ~ dstudent(2, mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + b1 * x,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		b1 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(0.5)
	),
	data = d
)

plot(
	x = d$x * x_s + x_m,
	y = d$y,
	xlab = "Tax rate",
	ylab = "Tax revenue"
)

m4_post <- rethinking::link(m4, data = x_vec) |> colMeans()
lines(
	x = x_tf, y = m1_post,
	lty = 1, col = "black",
	lwd = 2
)
lines(
	x = x_tf, y = m4_post,
	lty = 2, col = "firebrick3",
	lwd = 2
)
legend(
	x = "topleft",
	legend = c("Gaussian", "T(2 d.f.)"),
	lwd = c(2, 2),
	lty = c(1, 2),
	col = c("black", "firebrick3")
)
```

Interestingly, we can see that if we use a Student's $t$ likelihood which is
less susceptible to the influence of outliers, the line is flatter, reflecting
the fact that the outlier was dragging the slope upwards. Excluding this
outlier, which has an unusually high tax revenue compared to its tax rate,
gives us a line that matches the rest of the points better.

Of course, this change is not too dramatic. Let's look at the summary.

```{r}
summary(m4)
```

The change in the coefficient is within the standard error of that coefficient
from the first model, so as long as we don't fall victim to pointeffectism (
AKA point-estimate-is-the-effect syndrome), this doesn't change our conclusions
really at all. This is because while that point is an outlier, it is not
incredibly influential. I.e., in standard frequentist linear regression theory,
the leverage of that point would not be exceptionally high, indicating that it
does not have that much power to influence the coefficient estimates on its
own. An outlier with a more extreme $x$ value would influence the estimates
more.

### 7H3

The first thing we need to do for this problem is type in the data.

```{r}
birds <- matrix(
	c(0.2, 0.8, 0.05, 0.2, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.05, 0.7, 0.2, 0.025, 0.05,
		0.2, 0.025, 0.05),
	ncol = 5,
	nrow = 3,
	dimnames = list(
		paste("Island", 1:3),
		paste("Species", LETTERS[1:5])
	)
)
birds
```

Next, we want to compute the entropy of each island's bird distribution.

```{r}
h <- apply(birds, 1, \(p) -sum(p * log(p)))
round(h, 2)
```

Island 1 has the highest entropy, followed by Island 3, and finally Island 2.
This is because Island 1 has an even distribution of birds, which gives us
the maximum possible entropy of an island with five bird species. We can
think of this intuitively as a measurement of our uncertainty in which type of
bird we will see. If we see a random bird on Island 1, there is an equally
likely chance for it to be any of the species, so any guess we make should
be quite uncertain.

However, on Island 2 one scecies represents 80\% of birds on the island,
and similar on Island 3, one species represents 70\% of birds on the island.
So if we saw a random bird on Island 3, we could make a decent guess about the
species, and an even stronger guess on Island 2. So the decreasing entropies
reflect our lowered uncertainty about the type of bird we guess we might see.

Next we want to compute the KL divergence between each pair of islands.

```{r}
kl <- function(p, q) {return(sum(p * (log(p) - log(q))))}

pairs <-
	tidyr::expand_grid(p = 1:3, q = 1:3) |>
	dplyr::filter(p != q) |>
	dplyr::mutate(
		div = purrr::map2_dbl(p, q, \(x, y) kl(birds[x, ], birds[y, ]))
	)

pairs
```

These are the KL divergence values if we used the distribution of island $p$
to predict the distribution of island $q$. We see that it's very difficult
to predict island 2 from island 3 and vice versa. Predictions using Island 1
are always much better, regardless of the direction. However, it is much easier
to predict Island 3 from Island 1 and vice versa, then trying to predict Island
1 using Island 2 (or vice versa). This is because Island 1 has the maximum
entropy, so reflects the maximum amount of uncertainty in our predictions --
therefore using Island 1 is the safest way to make a prediction in any other
island, because we are expressing the highest amount of uncertainty that we
can in this situation.

Island 3 and 1 are more compatible in predictions than
Island 2 and 1 because the difference in entropy between Islands 1 and 3 is
smaller than between Islands 1 and 2. Islands 2 and 3 are almost completely
dominated by 2 bird species each, but the dominant species are different
between the islands, so using one to predict the other is very wrong. That is,
we are using one distribution with extreme values to predict another
distribution with different extreme values, so our predictions are more wrong
on average.

### 7H4

OK, the first thing we need to do is type in all that code from the book
to recreate the models, so I'll do that without comments.

```{r}
d <- sim_happiness(seed = 1977, N_years = 1000)
d2 <- d[d$age > 17, ]
d2$A <- (d2$age - 18) / (65 - 18)
d2$mid <- d2$married + 1

m6.9 <- quap(
	alist(
		happiness ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a[mid] + bA * A,
		a[mid] ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d2
)

m6.10 <- quap(
	alist(
		happiness ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- a + bA * A,
		a ~ dnorm(0, 1),
		bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = d2
)
```

Since McElreath says that WAIC and PSIS produce identical results here, we'll
go ahead and use WAIC since it's like one second faster.

```{r}
rethinking::compare(m6.9, m6.10)
```

We can see that the WAIC for m6.9 is much lower than the WAIC for m6.10, even
if we consider the magnitude of the standard errors -- the WAICs are multiple
standard errors apart, so m6.9 should do a better job at generating predictions
than m6.10. Let's look at the model parameters.

```{r}
precis(m6.9, depth = 2)
precis(m6.10)
```

Of course, we know from the previous chapter than `m6.9` is **conditioning
on a collider**! And `m6.10` produces the correct causal inference. However,
we have to remember the crucial fact that **colliders and confounders contain
information**. As McElreath says earlier in this chapter, "highly confounded
models can still make good predictions, at least in the short term." So
the model that makes the wrong causal conclusion has better predictive accuracy
than the correct model, but this should not surprise us too much -- this is
why building a causal model is so important.

### 7H5

For this exercise, we'll go back to the foxes data. We have five models
that we need to fit, using the fox weight as the outcome. I'll go ahead and
fit those models in the order indicated in the question. I did the same data
processing as in the previous chapter, taking the log of the outcome and then
standardizing all of the variables.

```{r}
set.seed(987865)
data(foxes)
f2 <-
	foxes |>
	dplyr::transmute(
		A = area,
		F = avgfood,
		G = groupsize,
		W = log(weight)
	) |>
	as.list() |>
	lapply(FUN = rethinking::standardize)

mf.1 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + bF * F + bG * G + bA * A,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bG ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = f2
)

mf.2 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + bF * F + bG * G,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bG ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = f2
)

mf.3 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + bG * G + bA * A,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bG ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = f2
)

mf.4 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + bF * F,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bF ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = f2
)

mf.5 <- rethinking::quap(
	alist(
		W ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
		mu <- b0 + bA * A,
		b0 ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		bA ~ dnorm(0, 2),
		sigma ~ dexp(1)
	),
	data = f2
)

rethinking::compare(mf.1, mf.2, mf.3, mf.4, mf.5)
```

Ok, so the main thing that I can see is that Model 1, 2, and 3 are all similar,
and model 4 and 5 are similar. But following McElreath's notion to exam
the standard error of the differences, we can see that all the models
are actually not too different. However, we can see that model 1 and model 3
are quite similar, whereas the others have larger standard errors.

If we look at the plot we can definitely see two groups of models.

```{r}
plot(rethinking::compare(mf.1, mf.2, mf.3, mf.4, mf.5))
```

If we look back at the DAG, maybe we can understand why there are two groups
of models.

```{r}
fox_dag <-
	dagitty::dagitty(
		"dag {
		A -> F -> G -> W
		F -> W
		}"
	)
dagitty::coordinates(fox_dag) <-
	list(
		x = c(A = 2, F = 1, G = 3, W = 2),
		y = c(A = 1, F = 2, G = 2, W = 3)
	)
plot(fox_dag)
```

So the groups that are similar are:
1. (avgfood, groupsize, area) and (avgfood, groupsize) and (groupsize, area);
2. (avgfood only) and (area only).

So the main difference between the models is the inclusion of the `groupsize`
variable, $G$ in the DAG. We can see that $G$ is a mediator of the relatioship
between $F$ and $W$ here.

When we fit only `avgfood` or only `area`, it makes sense that the two models
are the same -- the effect of `area` is entirely through its effect on
`avgfood`, so those two models are essentially finding the same effect.

However, when we include the mediator we get slightly different results.
Interestingly, we're still only capturing one causal effect, because the
effect of everything else comes from `area`. But it seems that the predictive
model is better when we control for `groupsize` -- why would this be, if we
are still only capturing descendants of `area`? I think that this is because,
as we also know, conditioning on a variable which is the ancestor of the 
outcome can lead to
increased precision in our estimates. So even though we aren't getting any
"new" signal here, and all of the models with `groupsize` in them perform
similarly, we get slightly more efficient estimates, which can increase
our predictive accuracy on average. It may also be the case that estimating
the effect of the `groupsize` is a statistical issue -- this variable is
integer valued, and we're modeling it like a continuous value, but because
we only have a discrete set of actual observations, this may reduce the
precision of our estimate, since there's a lot of "space" in the groupsize-axis
that isn't covered by any measurements.

We can also see that model 3 had the best WAIC overall, and it specifically
includes the two variables which are direct ancestors of the treatment,
so maybe that supports my idea or maybe it is a coincidence, I'm not too sure.

Anyways, I think this is mostly a statistical phenomenon. There are no
confounders or colliders here, everything is just direct or indirect effects
of the effect of area on weight.
